    Extensions for "ma"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This directory contains a number of extensions for "ma"[1], a small "Acme"[2]  clone,
written in Tcl/Tk. Note that all of this is hacked together for personal use, sufficient to
do the job, but neither polished not perfect. Use at your own risk and modify to your
liking.


• "snippets.tcl": Entering unicode characters using dmenu[3], similar to the compose key in Plan 9.

    Put the program "snip" in your PATH, and add this to ~/.ma:

       DefineKey <Control-q> {
          set f [open "| snip < /dev/null" r]
          Insert [string trim [read $f]]
           catch [list close $f]
       }

    Change the location of "snippets.tcl" in the "snip" script to something appropriate for your 
    setup.

• "hooks.tcl": Simple hooks when loading files with a particular extension.

     source <path>/hooks.tcl

      AddFileHook {\.(c|h|cpp)$} {
         global indent_mode
         set indent_mode 1
     }

• "ctags.tcl": Support for locating definitions in programs for various languages with ctags(1)

      source <path>/ctags.tcl

    Defines a command named "Tag" that locates the selected word, or the word under dot.
    Also works as "Tag <word>". The generated "tags" file must be in the current directory.

• "scheme-indent.tcl": (very) simple Scheme indentation.

      source <path>/scheme-indent.tcl

    Enabled with the "SchemeIndent" command, consider adding this:

        AddFileHook {\.(scm|ss|scheme|meta|setup)$} SchemeIndent

• "archive.tcl": dump contents of archive files on B3.

• "mark.tcl": mark regex or address with color.

• "gopher.tcl": minimal gopher client.

    Uses "gopher" tool for retrieving pages.

* "project.tcl": simple "project" files.

      source <path>/project.tcl

    When opening a file or directory, any file named ".ma.p" in the same directory
    or one of its parent directories will be loaded once.

• "savedstate.tcl": save font/colors for every saved file and restore when reopened.

• Color themes: Simple color schemes.

        set theme_counter 1
        source <path>/colors/solarized.tcl
        ⁝

    The functiion keys select the current color scheme.

• Tools:

    g EXPRESSION

        Invokes grep(1) with argument EXPRESSION for usual text and source code files.

    gg EXPRESSION

        Shorthand for "git grep"

    h [EXPRESSION]

        Grep EXPRESSION in history file, or show last 30 entries.

    upcase

        Read text and convert to uppercase, copy (or symlink) this to "downcase" to
        do the opposite.

    unquote

        Unquote E-mail text (remove leading "> ")

    ind [N]

        Indent input by N characters (defaults to 4), copy or symlink to "unind" to unindent.


All of this code is placed in the public domain.
